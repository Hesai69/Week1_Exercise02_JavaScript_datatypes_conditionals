##Practice Loops!!!
## WHILE LOOPS
Create a while loop that will `console.log` every number from 1-9


As an exercise I want you all to put this into practice

* Create an array of all the members of The Beatles!
* Loop through The Beatles, and console.log each one introducing himself.

## FOR LOOPS
Let's loop through an array of people and `console.log` both the `index` and the `element`.

```js
  var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14];
```

* Create a loop that only prints out multiples of 3.
* Print only even numbers in the array

Why don't we convert our Beatles while loop that we wrote a few minutes ago and convert it to a `for` loop!
