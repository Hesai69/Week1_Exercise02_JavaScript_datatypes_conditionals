##Practice Basic Javascript! Data types, variables, arrays

### Open Chrome console, and go wild!!!!

- Create a variable, what happens when you do not assign the variable a value?
- Now, assign the variable a value
        **make sure you try assigning all primitive data-types**
- Test typeof, with the variable you created, try it for all data-types

Now try this:
```
"carrot" - "car"

6 - 3
```

 try this:
```
3 + 5

"tea" + "pot"
```
### Lets play with some in-built methods

Try this in your console:
```
"hello".length

3.length
```
